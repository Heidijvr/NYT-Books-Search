# React Google Book Search


The Google Boook Search Application is a React-based Search app. It requires creating React components, helper/util functions, and utilizing React lifecycle methods, to query and display books based on user searches. It also involves using Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

**This application consists of the following 2 pages:**

A *Search* page - where the user can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. The user has the option to "View" a book, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

A *Saved* page - this page renders all books saved to the Mongo database. The user has the option to "View" the book, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.
